"""PreToolUse guard that makes role boundaries real instead of prompt etiquette.

Three jobs, selected by tool_name.

On Read it polices *what gets pulled into context*. Replaying context is 69.6% of this
project's measured spend ($387 of $556 on the main session across 30 sessions, at an
average 191k tokens per turn), and a large file read once is re-billed on every remaining
turn of the session. Bounded reads (`limit` set) are always allowed. `scribe` is denied
the archives outright — it writes them but never needs to read them.

On Agent|Task it polices *who gets dispatched*. The built-in discovery agents inherit
the caller's model, so `Explore` does scout's job at Opus prices — measured at $1.88
per run against $0.12 for scout.

On Write|Edit|NotebookEdit it polices *what a role may write*, and rejects any
future-dated timestamp written into a tracking record — a record logs what already
happened, so a future stamp is fabricated. Every hook payload carries `agent_type`, so
one script can police both the main session and each subagent:

  main session  -> writing production code or a tracking record is the exact leak
                   that turns this project into a single Opus session. Escalate to
                   the user (ask) instead of letting it happen silently.
  builder       -> production code only; tests and docs belong to other roles.
  scribe        -> docs/agent/ only.
  scout         -> read-only.

Unknown agent types are not policed: this guard owns the routing roles, not every
agent that may run in the repo.

Env overrides:
  ROUTING_GUARD=off   disable entirely
  ROUTING_MAIN=deny|ask|off   main-session severity (default ask)
  ROUTING_READ_KB=<n> main-session large-read threshold in KB (default 32; 0 disables)
