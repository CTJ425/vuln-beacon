description: The version number determination rule of stock-pnl-web. Use it when you want to determine the next version number, increment dev.N on the dev branch, merge dev into main for final version, or write a docs/agent/CHANGELOG.md version record.

# Version number specification details

Prerequisite (stated in `CLAUDE.md` § Versioning): the version number does not have the `v` prefix.
Keep these synchronized:

- `sources/src/version.ts` → `APP_VERSION` (UI badge)
- `sources/package.json` → `version` (with `package-lock.json`)
- `README.md` → version badge line only
- `docs/agent/CHANGELOG.md` → version history

**`dev` and `main` must never disagree on the version string after a sync.** After every release merge, fast-forward so both tips carry the **same** finalized `x.x.x`.

---

## Official version (`main` branch / release commit)

Format: **`x.x.x`** (semver, no suffix).

- Bump patch from the previous official version (`0.3.6` → `0.3.7`), unless the change is large enough for minor/major.
- The release commit (or the commit that finalizes the merge into `main`) is the **only** place that may drop `-dev.N`.
- `docs/agent/CHANGELOG.md` title for that version is the official number (no “under development”).

---

## Development versions (`dev` and feature work)

Format: **`x.x.x-dev.N`** (dot between `dev` and `N`, not a second hyphen).

| Piece | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| `x.x.x` | The **next** official version this line of work will become when released |
| `N` | Sequential change count on that target, starting at **1** |

Examples: target `0.6.48` → first change `0.6.48-dev.1`, second `0.6.48-dev.2`.

### When to put `-dev`

- **Any non-release work on `dev`** (features, fixes, docs that ship with a version bump): use `x.x.x-dev.N`.
- After an official `x.x.x` is on both branches, the **next** edit that needs a version bump starts at **`(x.x.x + patch)-dev.1`**, not a bare `x.x.x` on `dev`.
- Do **not** leave `dev` showing a bare official number while unfinished work is in progress.

### When to remove `-dev`

- **Only on the official release commit** that merges to `main` (or the finalization commit on that path): strip `-dev.N` → `x.x.x`, finalize CHANGELOG, then `git push origin main:dev` so both branches match.

## merge into main (release checklist)

1. Confirm the target official number (e.g. work was `0.6.48-dev.3` → release **`0.6.48`**).
2. Set `version.ts` / `package.json` / lock / README badge to **`0.6.48`** (no `-dev`).
3. Finalize `docs/agent/CHANGELOG.md` under that official heading.
4. Merge to `main`, push (Pages deploys).
5. **Sync branches**: `git push origin main:dev` (or merge main→dev) so **dev and main show the same `0.6.48`**.
6. **Publish a GitHub Release** for the tag, using that version's `CHANGELOG.md` section as the body
   (see § GitHub Releases below).
7. Next feature on `dev`: first versioned change → **`0.6.49-dev.1`**.

## GitHub Releases

`docs/agent/CHANGELOG.md` stays the **source of truth** — it is not a hot file (nothing reads it at
session start), so nothing is moved out of it. The Release is a convenience mirror that makes
`gh release view 0.7.13` a precise, cheap lookup instead of a grep through 48k characters.

```bash
gh release create 0.7.13 --title 0.7.13 --notes-file <that version's CHANGELOG section>
```

- No `v` prefix on the tag — it matches the version string exactly (CLAUDE.md § Versioning).
- ⚠️ **The repo is public and a Release body has no secret-scanning gate.** Paste only the
  CHANGELOG section, which is already committed and therefore already passed push protection.
  Never hand-add logs, `cron.job.command` text, or Edge output to a release body.
- Only official `x.x.x` releases get one. `-dev.N` never does.
- **Starts at `0.7.14`.** Versions up to and including `0.7.13` are deliberately **not** backfilled
  (user decision, 2026-08-12) — `CHANGELOG.md` already covers them and backfilling would publish
  ~40 releases at once on a public repo. Do not "complete" the history.

Purpose: official and pre-release numbers stay aligned; there is never a gap where main is `0.3.6` while dev already claims `0.3.8` without a release, and dev does not sit on a bare release number mid-work.
